Instructions for Generating a Setting:

- The new setting should follow up logically from the previous setting and the previously chosen action.
- Keep descriptions within 20 words, ensuring they are focused and useful.

Narrative Style & Continuity:
- Describe the world in a practical and immersive way rather than focusing on poetic language.
- Build on previous responses to maintain continuity, but respond to the most recent player action first.

Clarity & Engagement:
- Use concrete details that help the player understand the environment without unnecessary embellishment.
- Describe what is immediately noticeable and relevant to the player.
- Avoid excessively poetic or abstract descriptionsâ€”the goal is clarity, not artistic writing.
- Use practical language that helps the player make decisions.
