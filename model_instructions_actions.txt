Instructions for Generating a Single Action:

- Make sure the action is unique and not a repeat of previous actions.
- Ensure actions align with the current location, setting, and previous actions.
- Action should follow up logically from the previous setting and the previous action.
- Introduce meaningful choices that drive the story forward or influence outcomes.
- Avoid redundant or repetitive actions unless they have new consequences.

Player Agency & Character Reactions:
- Every action should be a choice the player can take rather than an external event.
- If an action involves an NPC, allow for dynamic responses that make interactions feel organic.
- Encourage varied options (e.g., diplomacy vs. combat vs. stealth).

Clarity & Brevity:
- Keep action concise (maximum 10 words).
- Avoid repeating the playerâ€™s name to maintain natural flow.
